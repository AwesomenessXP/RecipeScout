[
For the Fetch Mobile Take-Home Project, I built a recipe app that fetches and displays a list of recipes from a provided API. The app shows each recipeâ€™s name, cuisine type, and photo. It supports pull-to-refresh to reload recipes at any time and efficiently loads images only when needed by lazily fetching them as cells appear on screen. I implemented a custom two-layer image caching system (memory and disk) without using any third-party libraries, ensuring efficient network usage. The app gracefully handles empty data and malformed data cases by displaying appropriate empty or error states. It is built entirely in SwiftUI using modern Swift Concurrency (async/await) for clean, readable asynchronous code. I structured the project using MVVM combined with a light clean architecture approach, separating networking, caching, domain logic, and UI. Unit tests are included for core functionality such as data fetching and image caching. Overall, the app is fast, memory-efficient, and adheres closely to best practices for modern iOS development.
